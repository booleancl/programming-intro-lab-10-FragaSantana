# Object Oriented Programming in Python 3

Each folder has an example with corresponding tests of a class with one or two features of the Python Object Oriented Approach 

### Setup command
`sudo -H pip3 install pytest`

### Run command
`pytest`

### Notes
- pip's install path is not included in the PATH var by default, so without installing via `sudo -H`, pytest would be unaccessible.
